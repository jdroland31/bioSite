                        Nicholas always had a fascination with history, especially that of North America. He went through progressive phases starting with everything he could read about Native Americans, especially before the arrival of Europeans on the continent.
                        He planted corn, lima beans and squash in his own small plot in our parents' backyard garden so he could make succotash, and crafted pouches and moccasins from deer hide. He wanted to see and feel history, and live it. He progressed on in similar fashion to the early settlers, then the Revolutionary War, then the Civil War and into the early modern period.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I remember being dragged along to many a fort, battleground, museum and living history site by my parents when we lived for a few years in Virginia. While I was bored to tears, ripped away from my Power Rangers and computer games, Nicholas was ecstatic. Here it all was in real dimensions and carefully preserved! The hook was set.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My brother's voracious appetite for reading paid off in his studies at school. He kept up excellent grades and joined a German language club in middle school where he became capable, if not yet fluent with the language. He also played in Ayso soccer teams and later began running on the cross country team at school.

                        Nicholas continued his academic success in high school and began to formulate a plan for what would come next. He joined the school's Navy Junior ROTC program and by his senior year had become Executive Officer of the cadets. Between a strong family tradition of military service and the frequent overlap of military history with the story of America, military service was a natural future goal.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During this time Nicholas continued with cross country on the high school team, eventually as a varsity runner. Re-enacting became a hobby pursuit with a focus on Revolutionary and Civil War eras.
                        He was also known to join friends on paintball and airsoft excursions, and began learning how to hunt and live outdoors.

                        Nicholas never really lost his connection to the state of Virginia, so when it came time to apply for schools he picked out Virginia Tech. He wasn't just interested in history, but VT's military college as well. The VT Corps of Cadets was a formative experience and a point of pride for my brother. He tried out for and made it into the Corp's elite Ranger platoon, wrestling a cadre member for his beret at the end of a grueling selection period. During this time he also joined the Virginia National Guard as an enlisted man, completing his training in the summer between classes.

                    <p>
                        I visited Nicholas several times at the Virginia Tech campus and came to appreciate the Blacksburg area myself. My brother's love of Hokie football is sealed in for life, and it has rubbed off on me a bit as well. While I've never been much of a sports fan, home games in Lane stadium have a peerless energy. VT students pack the house and brim with enthusiasm. The team storms the field to Metallica's 'Enter Sandman', the entire Corps of Cadets attends in full uniform, and every touchdown is celebrated with the thunderous report of Skipper, the Corp's black powder canon, just outside the stadium. I would not want to play the Hokies on their home turf.

                        After four years of hard work, Nicholas graduated with a degree in North American history and, after passing Officer Candidate School training, accepted his commission as a new Second Lieutenant in the United States Army. He would then be assigned to a Stryker Brigade Combat Team as a Platoon Leader. After a training evolution he deployed to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. He went on to attend several Army training schools, earning his Ranger tab and jump wings and fulfilling a number of leadership positions. By the completion of the 4 years of service he was bound to in return for educational assistance he had achieved the rank of Captain.

                        Though he was no longer obligated to continue service, Nicholas decided to transfer to the National Guard and set his sights on Texas. He had become highly interested in the PhD program at UT Austin. He applied for and was accepted into the program, and his National Guard orders came through to support the move. He continued to train and lead in the National Guard while alternating between being a student, a researcher, and teaching assistant at UT.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If Virginia left an impression on Nicholas, Texas did so at least equally. He came to love the city of Austin's amazing barbecue, live music, and the Alamo drafthouse movie theater. He toured a great many historical sites both for research and for fun. The Texas country called to him as well with hiking, camping and outdoor music festivals. He hunted deer and wild pigs, often building up a smoker pit in his back yard for the pigs and doing his own barbecues. With the high cost of living in Austin and meager pay for part time work in the Guard, he kept his fridge full with meat from hunting excursions in the Texas hillsides.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I visited Nicholas several times in Texas, the first being on a road trip from California to Tennessee when I had finished my enlistment in the Marine Corps. He introduced me to the city and all his favorite bars and food spots. I went back again a year later just to hang out, and a third time when he had earned his PhD. Since he had recently been promoted to Major in the Guard, this led to some joking about what to call him. Doctor Major Roland? Major Doctor Roland?

                        After earning his PhD, Nicholas began his search for positions that would lead to a career as a historian. While this is a competitive field, he did secure a position with the Navy Historical Archive in Washington D.C. as an archivist. The irony of a Soldier acting as caretaker for Navy history was not lost on me. Nicholas continued his National Guard service, transferring from Texas to Virginia and taking on various roles, at times taking on stints of active service such as training cadre for the Officer Candidate school. He recently paused his Navy Archive position to accept an active duty assignment with the Guard, where is overseeing the development of a massive training exercise due for nearly all Virginia National Guard units later this year. His chief future goal is a professorship teaching North American history at a university in the southeast or in Texas.
